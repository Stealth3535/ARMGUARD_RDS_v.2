| **Network Verification** | `verify-network.sh` | `02_config.sh::verify_network_configuration()` | ✅ **Fully Integrated** |

### **2. Dependency Audit Results**

#### **Main Scripts Dependencies: ✅ CLEAN**
- `01_setup.sh` - ✅ No dependencies on network_setup
- `02_config.sh` - ✅ No dependencies (contains integrated functionality)  
- `03_services.sh` - ✅ No dependencies on network_setup
- `04_monitoring.sh` - ✅ No dependencies on network_setup

#### **Helper Scripts Dependencies: ✅ UPDATED**
- `deployment-helper.sh` - ✅ Updated to reference integrated system
- `cleanup-validator.sh` - ✅ Updated to show "INTEGRATED" status

#### **Enterprise Scripts Dependencies: ✅ HANDLED**
- `methods/production/master-deploy.sh` - ✅ Updated to gracefully handle missing network_setup
  - **Before**: Hard dependency on network_setup scripts
  - **After**: Graceful fallback with integrated system guidance

#### **Documentation Dependencies: ✅ UPDATED**
- `README.md` - ✅ Updated network setup guidance
- `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - ✅ Updated with integrated approach
- `methods/production/README.md` - ✅ Updated network setup reference

## 🔍 **Technical Verification**

### **Search Results for Active Dependencies**

```bash
# Executable calls to network_setup (NONE FOUND):
grep -r "\.\/network_setup\/" deployment_A/*.sh
# Result: No active calls in main scripts

# Source/include statements (NONE FOUND):  
grep -r "source.*network_setup\|include.*network_setup" deployment_A/*.sh
# Result: No source statements found

# Directory references in scripts (HANDLED):
grep -r "network_setup" deployment_A/*.sh
# Result: Only comments and graceful fallbacks
```

### **Functionality Testing Checklist**

✅ **LAN Deployment** - `02_config.sh` option 1 provides all LAN features  
✅ **WAN Deployment** - `02_config.sh` option 3 provides all WAN features  
✅ **Hybrid Deployment** - `02_config.sh` option 2 provides complete isolation  
✅ **SSL Management** - Both mkcert and ACME fully functional  
✅ **Firewall Configuration** - Advanced rules with fail2ban integrated  
✅ **Network Verification** - Comprehensive validation included

## 📂 **Files Safe for Removal**

All files in `network_setup/` folder are safe to remove:

| File | Size | Purpose | Integrated Location |
|------|------|---------|---------------------|
| `setup-lan-network.sh` | ~263 lines | LAN setup | `02_config.sh::configure_lan_network()` |
| `setup-wan-network.sh` | ~392 lines | WAN setup | `02_config.sh::configure_wan_network()` |
| `configure-firewall.sh` | ~308 lines | Firewall rules | `02_config.sh::configure_*_firewall()` |
| `verify-network.sh` | ~150+ lines | Network validation | `02_config.sh::verify_network_configuration()` |
| `nginx-lan.conf` | Template | LAN nginx config | Generated by `configure_lan_nginx()` |
| `nginx-wan.conf` | Template | WAN nginx config | Generated by `configure_wan_nginx()` |
| `README.md` | Documentation | Network guide | Info in `NETWORK_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` |
| `HYBRID_NETWORK_GUIDE.md` | Documentation | Hybrid setup | Concepts included in integrated system |

**Total Removal**: ~1,113+ lines of code + documentation **safely integrated** into modular system.

## 🗑️ **Safe Removal Process**

### **Step 1: Verification**
```bash
# Test integrated system works
cd deployment_A
./02_config.sh --help  # Verify integrated functions load
./deployment-helper.sh  # Verify guidance system works
```

### **Step 2: Optional Backup**
```bash
# Create backup if desired (optional)
cp -r network_setup/ network_setup_BACKUP_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

### **Step 3: Removal**
```bash
# Remove the deprecated folder
rm -rf network_setup/
```

### **Step 4: Validation**
```bash
# Verify system still works perfectly
./deployment-helper.sh  # Should work without issues
./01_setup.sh && ./02_config.sh  # Network options should be available
```
