Perfect! Let’s make a clear, step-by-step guide for setting up a private web server that can be accessed securely via LAN + WAN, using WireGuard, OpenVPN, or Tailscale. I’ll break it down so you can pick the method that fits your skill level.

1️⃣ WireGuard (Free, Fast, Modern)
Best for: technical users, fastest performance, strong security

Requirements: Server (Linux/Windows/Raspberry Pi), static or dynamic public IP

Setup Overview

Install WireGuard on the server

Linux: sudo apt install wireguard

Raspberry Pi: same as Linux

Windows: download from WireGuard official site

Generate keys for server & clients

wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey


Configure WireGuard server

[Interface]
PrivateKey = <server-private-key>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <client-public-key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32


Configure clients

Use client software on PC, mobile, etc.

Enter server public key & IP, private key for client

Test connection

Ping server IP (10.0.0.1)

Access web server: http://10.0.0.5 (LAN) or via VPN IP (WAN)

Optional: Use HTTPS inside VPN (self-signed SSL or internal CA)

2️⃣ OpenVPN (Free, Secure, Battle-tested)
Best for: more traditional VPN setup, more configuration options

Requirements: Server with Linux/Windows, port forwarding if behind router

Setup Overview

Install OpenVPN server

sudo apt install openvpn easy-rsa


Generate server & client certificates

Configure server (server.conf)

Choose port (UDP 1194 recommended)

Set IP range for VPN (e.g., 10.8.0.0/24)

Configure clients (.ovpn file)

Install OpenVPN client

Import configuration

Connect client → VPN → access server

Browser access via VPN IP (no domain required)

✅ OpenVPN is slightly heavier, but excellent for technical setups

3️⃣ Tailscale (Easiest, Free for small teams)
Best for: Non-technical users, simple setup, automatic NAT traversal

Requirements: Any server (Linux, Raspberry Pi, Windows)

Setup Overview

Install Tailscale on server

curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
sudo tailscale up


Install Tailscale on client devices

Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux

Login with Google/GitHub account

Server gets a unique Tailscale IP

Example: 100.x.x.x

Connect client → access private web server

http://100.x.x.x


Optional HTTPS inside Tailscale VPN (not required, already encrypted)

✅ Tailscale automatically works across LAN + WAN without port forwarding.

Comparison
Feature	WireGuard	OpenVPN	Tailscale

Recommended Choice for Your Case

Non-technical / small team (<3 users) → Tailscale

Technical users / multiple clients / max performance → WireGuard

Legacy support / extra features → OpenVPN

If you want, I can make a full diagram + copy-paste setup for LAN + WAN that uses all three options, showing exactly how your users would connect securely.
